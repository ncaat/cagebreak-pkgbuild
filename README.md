# Cagebreak Archlinux Package

This repository provides a PKGBUILD for [cagebreak](https://github.com/project-repo/cagebreak).

All releases on master are tagged corresponding to the cagebreak release and signed.

For every release we provide a tarball containing at least `.SRCINFO` and `PKGBUILD`
and a corresponing signature as release assets.

We will soon provide a PKGBUILD in the [AUR](aur.archlinux.org).

## Signing Keys

The following keys are valid:

  * A9C386EFBEB0819C5523E6AB2AD89C95DEA1AE85

Note that the key is signed by some signing keys of the cagebreak project.
